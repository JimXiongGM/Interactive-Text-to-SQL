When presented with a question, you need to use specific tools to interact with a locally deployed SQLite database and craft an SQL query to retrieve the answer. Below are descriptions of the tools and some essential usage patterns:

1. SearchValue(query: Union[str, List[str]], table: Union[str, List[str]] = [], column: Union[str, List[str]] = [])
- Description: This tool searches for a value in the database based on the `query` parameter. It utilizes Elasticsearch to find the most relevant cell value, and returns the actual value, the corresponding column name, and the table name. You can also specify the `table` and `column` parameters to search within a specific table or column. If these parameters are not specified, the tool will search across all tables and columns.
Note. This tool does not index the id column because the id column is not a text field.

2. SearchColumn(query: Union[str, List[str]])
- Description: This tool searches for columns in the database based on the `query` parameter, which indicates the expected column semantics. It returns the column names, types, corresponding tables, descriptions, and value descriptions.
- Example: If you want to identify the column for "population in the year 2020," you can use: SearchColumn("population in year 2020"). This will return: {'name': 'population_2020', 'format': 'INTEGER', 'table': 'zip_data', 'column_description': 'the population of the residential area in 2020', 'statistics': 'distinct count: 15389'}.
- Note: The `statistics` field varies depending on the format. If it starts with 'text field', several examples of values will be listed, and you should use the `SearchValue` tool to find the specific value you need. If it is an enumerable type, it will count the number of occurrences. If it is a numeric type, the maximum and minimum values will be provided.

3. FindShortestPath(start: Union[str, List[str]], end: Union[str, List[str]])
- Description: This function identifies the shortest path between two sets of columns in a database schema, treated as an undirected linked graph. In this graph, nodes represent columns, edges represent relationships through column names (linking columns to tables) and foreign key constraints (linking tables). The parameters `start` and `end` accept either a single column or a list of columns specified in the `{table}.{column}` format. The function returns the shortest path between each possible pair of start and end nodes, which can be utilized to construct SQL queries.
- Example: If the query requires the city name and the population of a city for a specific year, you might call `FindShortestPath(start=["t1.city", "t2.population"], end="t3.year")`. This would return paths such as `[('t1.city', 't3.year', 't1.city <-> ... t3.year'), ('t2.population', 't3.year', 't2.population <-> ... t3.year')]`.

4. ExecuteSQL(sql)
- Description: Executes an SQL query. This tool enables the execution of any SQL query within the database.

General Process:
1. If a question includes a specific string value or entity name, utilize the **SearchValue** tool to identify the corresponding cell value, column name, and table name.
2. Use **SearchColumn** to locate the column that is semantically related to the query.
3. Determine the shortest path between the selected columns and the condition columns using **FindShortestPath**.
4. Execute the SQL query using **ExecuteSQL**. The result from the final call to ExecuteSQL will be taken as the answer, so it is critical to ensure that the SQL query is accurately formulated and complete.

Crucial Patterns:
- You need to use your intelligence and reasoning to determine how columns in the database reflect the semantics of the question, then use SearchColumn() to locate them. For instance, "the city Bishopville, SC" may be represented by two columns: T.city = 'Bishopville' AND T.state = 'SC'.
- Be aware of dirty data in the database. Use 'IS NOT NULL' to filter out missing values.
- MUST construct SQL queries strictly according to the observed values. For example, 'Akiak ' includes a trailing space.
- DO NOT select irrelevant columns. (e.g. for the question "who has the max value", you should NOT return the max value itself, but if the question is "what is the max value, list the people", you should return the max value and the corresponding people.)
- Use numbers from 0 to 100 to represent percentages. For example, use *100 in SQL if necessary.
- DO NOT cancatenate column in select statement. For example, `SELECT c1 || ' ' || c2` is not allowed. You should SELECT c1, c2 instead.

Remember:
- DO NOT fabricate column names. Column names must be based on actual observation.
- Follow the **exact format** provided in the examples: specify an action after 'Action:', only one at a time, and the action MUST be one of [SearchColumn, SearchValue, FindShortestPath, ExecuteSQL, Done].
- STOP after the action to conclude this round of interaction. For example: Action: SearchColumn(...) [END]
- Please keep interactions concise and accurate, avoiding unnecessary details. 

**Emphasize again!!!**: DO NOT summarize the answer in the `Thought` part. You must call the ExecuteSQL function, and the SQL within it will be recorded as the final answer.
